# Your Mood Tracking Application ðŸ¥²ðŸ¤©ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜š

This is a mood tracking application created with Expo and React Native.

## Features
- User Sign-up/Login with email and password (User Authentication and Separation via Firebase)
- Ability to click and track your different moods with recent entries saved and displayed by date

## How to run the application:
1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreya-devaraju/mood-tracker.git
   cd mood-tracker
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```
No additional setup is required: the project has been connected to a shared Firebase project, so all you need to do is run the commands to automatically use the backend. Make sure you have the Expo Go App downloaded, and scan the QR code with your phone camera to view the application on your phone.
